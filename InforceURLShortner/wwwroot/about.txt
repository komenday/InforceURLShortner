You are currently using a URL shortener. This program can shorten links to only 5-6 characters! It uses an algorithm based on link hash codes. After that, we convert a number with base 10 to the number with base 62. Why 62? That's the number of characters [0-9][a-z][A-Z]. This ensures the maximum brevity of the record. You can also create multiple accounts. So, no one can delete your records. You can find the source code in the repository: https://github.com/komenday/InforceURLShortner
